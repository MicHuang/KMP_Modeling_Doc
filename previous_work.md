    From this section, we shall get some better understanding of the background pertaining the security problem we are going to analyse. What relevant works that has been done and where we need to improve. Also with the concepts and terms we are going to use in the following sections.

1. Routing Protocol Security
    The wide use of Internet in nowadays has make a great challenge to the information security. Routing protocols are used to exchange the topology information among routers within a single network or between different networks. According to the topology information, routers are able to selecting the best paths to forward packets that associated with the least cost. Without the correct routing information, forwarding of packets will be inefficient, unreachable and sometimes  causing meltdown to the whole network,  which makes the security of routing protocol the crucial problem that we have to deal with.
